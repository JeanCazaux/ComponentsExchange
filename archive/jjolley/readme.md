 :warning: Compatibility not known

This component allows you to grab any file from a Sharepoint server through http.
  It performs the necessary NTLM authentication.  The component takes the sharepoint file and creates a temporary copy of the file.  The temporary file name is stored in tSharepointFile.FILE and can be used with the rest of Talend's components.  The temporary file is deleted once the job has completed. (knowledgerelay.com)
