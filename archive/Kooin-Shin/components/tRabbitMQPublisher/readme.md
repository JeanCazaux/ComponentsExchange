### Overview
This component contributes to publish message to exchange on RabbitMQ. 
You can also create new exchange and new queue with entered name which is binded with queue and exchange. 
You can configure the appropriate option for exchange and queue like duration, auto-delete, exclusive, routing-key and etc.
It's also able to use arguments for detail operation. If your queue or exchange already exist by RabbitMQ server, you don't need to configure that. 
Message is packed that data of schematic columns will be serialized with header which is specifying length of column data.
Because of using column length header(Integer-4bytes), You don't no more have to use field separator for column.
Each columns is managed by type to support Talend schema type, Therefore you must be complied column type sequence of publisher when you receive data at consumer.
Being to support Talend type, It can able to send object which is Serializable by Java Serializable rule and to send object to consumer.  

If you want to design stream-based architecture which is part of Data-Streamer or DataLake-Synchronizer,
This component is best option for your system.

### Details
To enable to publish message to exchange of RabbitMQ.
To solve field separator in contents by field size header.
To support various Talend schema types.
To create new exchange on RabbitMQ with appropriate options e.g. exchange type(topic, direct, fanout, headers, x-jms-topic), durability, auto-delete...
To create new queue on RabbitMQ with appropriate options e.g. durability, auto-delete, exclusive...
To can use arguments for detail operations.
To make stream-base architecture system.
To be like apart of stream-based Streamer or DataLake-Synchronizer.
