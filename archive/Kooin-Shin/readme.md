  Hi all~ 

I am developer of hooking on Talend. My major field of programming is Java that is involving not only developing ETL but also Web, Application, Network developing etc. I imagine that all of developers work with interactive co-working.

I wish good days always be with you :)

Http Component Server(HCS) is providing powerful, elastic, well-formed development process to fulfill customer's various requirements that would be serviced with elasticity and efficiency. 
HCS is best alternatives about WEB, WAS or OLTP as mid-light weight server side service and it could to be a part of infrastructure service as Web or WAS which is much spending development time, complicated development, more-risky. 
HCS could be performing as if integrate variety task of server and furthermore, It will provide efficient and elastic service on MSA(Micro Service Architecture) that consists of small separated module.
Because of compling with component based development, Developer can develop service of business in 30 minutes if business specification and SQL querys are perpared.
As HCS is perfactly support to compatibillity of Talend Open Studio(TOS)'s components, Develper can use veriaty components of TOS. This is meaning that can using RDBMS, No-SQL, other storage components of TOS and Also can using On-Premise, Big-Data, Cloud(AWS, Google) components. Basically, it supports with basic compoent of Data process of TOS.
It could be replaced with WAS as Batch or API service. it provides very easy way to build service that drag and drop GUI components and just selecting UI options. 
Because of HCS is provided as TOS components, Existing TOS developer just follow that ways.

 :white_check_mark: Compatible with Talend 7.x / 8.x 

This component provide interval time opertation to process kafka bulk with users.
Basically you can be setting start date and end date on UI input form from component tap. Also if you are needed to set polling timeout and polling count, you can do it.
Normally You have only to input interval of time value. If you need to be set detail configuration of polling, you can configurate that. polling timeout is timeout value per one polling. polling count is polling count. In case of huge data polling process, data could't be fetched at once with single polling and sometimes could be empty. because of this, you can setting this value properly.

 :white_check_mark: Compatible with Talend 7.x / 8.x 

This component contribute to schedule multiple components process in a Talend job.

This component is bounded on Quartz Scheduler which is mostly used as scheduling working process as open-source library.
you can schedule various working bunch of Talend components by cron expression.
because of this, able to schedule multiple components in one job, It can be used as scheduling server of component groups or sub job.
basically, Talend job is based on single batch process but by using this component, you can create to compose concurrently different scheduled job process.
the scheduler is worked with defining cron expression and the component provide two different ways to define cron expression that is showed on basic setting in Talend Open Studio.

It's also able to use arguments for detail operation. If your queue or exchange already exist by RabbitMQ server, you don't need to configure that. 
Message is packed that data of schematic columns will be serialized with header which is specifying length of column data.
Because of using column length header(Integer-4bytes), You don't no more have to use field separator for column.
Each columns is managed by type to support Talend schema type, Therefore you must be complied column type sequence of publisher when you receive data at consumer.
Being to support Talend type, It can able to send object which is Serializable by Java Serializable rule and to send object to consumer.  

If you want to design stream-based architecture which is part of Data-Streamer or DataLake-Synchronizer,
This component is best option for your system.
