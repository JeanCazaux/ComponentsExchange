### Overview
This is a Processing Component Corresponding to my previous tFileInputKeyValue component.

Generates multiple columns from a given column containing key-value pairs.

It allows you to extract data from a field containing key-value pairs , using a Row >Main link.
Use this component to split a Field containing “key-value” pairs on the basis of “key”.
It extracts the “values” from the “keys”.
The “keys” are taken as fields and “values” as its contents.
(This component even allows empty key-value pairs and also in any order).
Useful in processing Log files.

The \\"tExtractKeyValue.zip\\" file contains the detailed Explanations about the Usage of the component.
