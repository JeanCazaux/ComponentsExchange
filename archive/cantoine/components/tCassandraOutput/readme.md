Quick summary about Cassandra : The Apache Cassandra Project develops a highly scalable second-generation distributed database, bringing together Dynamo's fully distributed design and Bigtable's ColumnFamily-based data model. 


Cassandra is in use at Digg, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Rackspace, Cloudkick, Cisco, SimpleGeo, Ooyala, OpenX, and more companies that have large, active data sets. The largest production cluster has over 100 TB of data in over 150 machines. 

# Rich Data Model
Allows efficient use for many applications beyond simple key/value.

# Elastic
Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications. 

All rewards should goes to Richie BALDWIN who has built this component in a day :)
