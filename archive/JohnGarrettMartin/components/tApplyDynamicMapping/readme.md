### Overview
Dynamic schema columns are cool, and these components make them cooler!

Use tLoadDynamicMap to load a set of dynamic mappings. the "key" is your source column name and the "value" is the target column name. 

Use tApplyDynamicMap to apply the mappings. It requires a dynamic schema column. if no matching re-mapping is found, the component will preserve the original mapping.
