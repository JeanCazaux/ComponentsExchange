### Overview
Upload of the CSV file with header in the line into the Vertica table.

The component receives the table schema from the database and associates its fields with the names of the columns in the file. It is possible to manually indicate the mapping of the association for the table fields and file columns which have different names. It is not required to describe the structures of the table fields in the component which allows to dynamically upload the data having previously unknown columns. It is possible to specify the mapping of fields from the input flow.
