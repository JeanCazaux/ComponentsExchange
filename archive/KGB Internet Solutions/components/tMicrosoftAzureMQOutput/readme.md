### Install Instructions
Batching output increases performance significantly, especially on high latency networks.
As input is streaming in, you can use the flush time to indicate the maximum time that should elapse before a batch is sent to Azure...the batch is kept in volitile memory until either the number of records in the batch is reached, or the flush time counter triggers sending the batch.
