 :warning: Compatibility not known

tBatch allows you to perform a subtask in batches.

Eg. fetch and write 10.000 records at a time from one database table into another.

This is very useful when you want to prevent memory issues that occur when Talend are handling too many records at a time (eg. if you try to load and process 10 mio. rows).

Unfortunately Talend Exchange does only allow me to upload 1 screenshot, so to see how to do the entire process please visit these links:
