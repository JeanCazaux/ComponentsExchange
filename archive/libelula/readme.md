 :warning: Compatibility not known

This component provides an option to load data into a VectorWise database instance using the COPY statement and reaching an outstanding performance with it.

All you need to configure:
- name of the node (created by NETUTIL available in ingres client)
- name of the database
- name of the table
- path and name of the source file
- path to the ".ingCLsh" file (optional, needed only on Linux systems, has a default value)
- the schema of the input file

This solution works on Windows and Linux environments.
