 :warning: Compatibility not known

An input component that creates a Talend flow from a Map collection. In particular, it generates a flow from the specified Iterable<Map<String, ?>> .

Extremely useful for those who do a lot of their Talend work in Java and need to construct flows from map collections.

Thanks to Carl Walker for inspiring this component.
