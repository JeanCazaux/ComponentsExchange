 :warning: Compatibility not known

This component takes the latitude and longitude as an input flow and retrieves the postcode from the Google Geocode API as an output.

I have also included support for business users, you will need to include your api-client name and your api-crypto key, this will automatically generate the signature for each url request to Google for you.
I have included support for connecting via a proxy server in advanced settings.

I have followed jlolling's directory structure and added this to the Business -> Google section of the palette the same as jlolling's (tGoogleAnalyticsInput)
