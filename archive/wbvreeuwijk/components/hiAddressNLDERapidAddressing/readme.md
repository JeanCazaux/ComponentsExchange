### Overview
This component provides the interface to the Human Inference HIquality Address rapid addressing for The Netherlands and Germany

Rapid Addressing retrieves the address from the knowledge table based on the postcode and the house number. It is possible that the user has made a typing error and that nevertheless a valid address is retrieved with this erroneous postcode or house number. To prevent this seemingly correct address from being found, Rapid Addressing uses check components (see below). In Germany the postcode and house number do not always result in a unique address, therefore check components are mandatory in Germany

Prerequisites: Human Inference Address rapid addressing for NL/DE.
