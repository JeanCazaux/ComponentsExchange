### Overview
This component provides the interface to the Human Inference HIquality Address standardisation for the rest of the world.

Based on the provided input the software tries to find the best fit for the address in the given country. If multiple addresses fit the input then they will be returned. The software also provides a reliability level of 1 to 3 where 1 is a sure match and 3 is a highly doubtful match.

The component supports two modes of operation:
1) Through a web-service
2) Stand-alone

In both case Human Inference software is needed.

Prerequisites: Human Inference Address WW standardisation.
