### Overview
The hiIdentifyExec component provides a means to start Human Inference HIquality Identify tasks. HIquality Identify is a high precision matching engine that uses linguistic knowledge to split client records into descriptions, slice them into chunks and evaluates each pair to find duplicated in relational data.

There are four steps that this component can be used for:
- Create: creates database structure according to the plan-file
- Build: build the descriptions according to the plan-file
- Dedup: deduplicate records based on evaluations in the plan-file
- Drop: drop the database components

Prerequisites: Human Inference HIquality software.
