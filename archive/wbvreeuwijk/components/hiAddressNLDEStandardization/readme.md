### Overview
This component provides the interface to the Human Inference HIquality Address standardisation for The Netherlands and Germany

Standardization retrieves the correct address based on any parts of the address. This can be done in an on-line search, or in a batch run to correct and standardize the addresses in a database.
Standardization has an effort setting and the maximum number of results and the separation character can be set. If an address could not be found, Standardization will try to format the input. Standardization returns the address according to a flexible format that can be configured in the output template

Prerequisites: Human Inference Address standardisation for NL/DE.
