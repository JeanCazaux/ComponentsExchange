### Overview
This component provides an interface to the Human Inference validate name functionality.

Validation Name checks if a person name exists. Company names cannot be validated, because an infinite number of word combinations and acronyms can be a valid company name.
Validation Name uses extensive knowledge of first names and surnames to determine if a name is valid, but it can still happen that a name is not (yet) added to the knowledge. It is possible to add the name to the user table or notify Human Inference to include the name in the next knowledge update. Human Inference offers regular updates of the knowledge.

Requirements: Human Inference software
