### Overview
This component helps to get the metadata of your GA4 properties into your own database.
The configuration is fairly simple, just reference a credential key json file and thats it. 
Take care the account email is added to your GA4 account.

The component collects:
* GA4 accounts
* GA4 properties
* GA4 dimension (including property specific dimensions)
* GA4 metrics (including property specific metrics)

Because the Google API ist a beta version yet, it will be changed in the future and most likely enhanced.
