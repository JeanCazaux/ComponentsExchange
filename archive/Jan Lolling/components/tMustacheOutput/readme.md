### Overview
Thgis component allows to render the data in 2 modes:
Mode 1: Every incoming row will be rendered into its own document (row by row). Actually it is also possible to change the template just within the flow.
Mode 2: All incomoing rows will be rendered into one document at the end of the flow.
### Details
* Use Mustache language to build text based documents
* Render all rows at once or every row for itself
* Can check if the template has fields required which does not exist in the incoming schema as column
