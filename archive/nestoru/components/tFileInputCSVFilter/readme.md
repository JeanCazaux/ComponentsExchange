### Overview
This is a component that takes a CSV file and output the row only if a lookup column matches certain content

For the latest version you should get this component from gitgub (https://github.com/nestoru/talend-custom-components) 

I believe github is the right place to share not only custom components but also the whole Talend Open Source project. Contributions using git are bigger, faster, easier. The Linux Kernel proved that first and many other projects including OpenJDK and Spring Framework use it as well.
