The tNetsuiteInput component allows you to read and search Netsuite entities via the Netsuite webservices API.

I also have a tNetsuiteOutput component I can upload if the community finds this useful.

Because of the way Netsuite manages child records (invoice items, addresses, etc), there are 2 other components designed to handle such child records: tNetsuiteListInput and tNetsuiteListOutput.

I have successfully used these components to migrate much data from Salesforce CRM including Accounts, Contacts, Cases, Opportunities, Activites, Messages. Attachments are also implemented but not yet tested.

This allows writing to Netsuite.

It requires tnetsuiteinput component as shared jar is in there.
