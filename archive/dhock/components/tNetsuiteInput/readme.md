### Overview
The tNetsuiteInput component allows you to read and search Netsuite entities via the Netsuite webservices API.

I also have a tNetsuiteOutput component I can upload if the community finds this useful.

Because of the way Netsuite manages child records (invoice items, addresses, etc), there are 2 other components designed to handle such child records: tNetsuiteListInput and tNetsuiteListOutput.

I have successfully used these components to migrate much data from Salesforce CRM including Accounts, Contacts, Cases, Opportunities, Activites, Messages. Attachments are also implemented but not yet tested.
