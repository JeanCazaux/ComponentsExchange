### Overview
This component is more a proof of concept than a serious addition to Talend. 
It plays any provided wave file, when executed.
Useful maybe, if you want audio feedback, when a subjob was processed or an error occured.

#### Release Notes

##### 0.101 - 2009-01-08 10:04:41
Tested with TOS 3.0.2 only, but for sure it will also work with 3.0.1 and 3.0.0 (and propably the older versions)
##### 0.2 - 2009-02-10 12:19:46
In the first release, a mismatch in the naming led to an error when the job was built. This version now works. I tested it on a plain TOS installation. 
I also did some minor improvements, like removing the connectors that made no sense and refactoring the class package included
### Compatible
 -  3.0 (obsolete)
